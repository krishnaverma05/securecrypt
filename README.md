SecureCrypt

SecureCrypt is a modern web application designed to provide secure password encryption and decryption using RSA public/private key cryptography. This application ensures data protection and confidentiality by leveraging robust encryption techniques powered by OpenSSL and a user-friendly interface built with React.

Features

RSA Key Generation: Generate secure public/private key pairs in PEM format.
Data Encryption: Encrypt plaintext messages using the public key.
Data Decryption: Decrypt encrypted messages using the private key.
Error Handling: Clear and detailed error messages for invalid operations.
Responsive Frontend: Intuitive and responsive interface for seamless user interaction.
Technology Stack

Frontend: React (TypeScript)
Backend: Flask (Python) with OpenSSL for cryptographic operations
Libraries Used:
OpenSSL (For RSA encryption/decryption)
Flask-CORS (For cross-origin requests)
